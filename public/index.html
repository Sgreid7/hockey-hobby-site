    <h1>Hello, Internet. This is a webpage about me.</h1>
    <header>My favorite hobby is hockey</header>
    <p>
      Hockey is a wildly fun and engaging sport played on ice with sticks and a
      puck. It's a face paced game and requires a lot of skill. Or you don't
      have to have a lot of skill, and that's okay, it's still fun to play!

      <li>You skate on ice</li>

      <li>It's unique and requires a lot of coordination</li>

    </ul>
